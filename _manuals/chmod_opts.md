This is a list of `chmod` options with examples. The examples are generated through an experiment using **chatGPT** to describe the usage of each option. The descriptions of the options are referenced from and can be searched in **manpage**.

### Version

Mac BSD General Commands Manual

### Option `-f` or `--silent`

#### Description

Do not display a diagnostic message if chmod could not modify the mode for file, nor modify the exit status to reflect such failures.

#### Example

```
$ chmod -f 644 file.txt
```

### Option `-v` or `--verbose`

#### Description

Cause chmod to be verbose, showing filenames as the mode is modified.  If the -v flag is specified more than once, the old and new modes of the file will also be printed, in both octal and symbolic notation.

#### Example

```
$ chmod -v 644 file.txt
```

### Option `-R` or `--recursive`

#### Description

Change the modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the files, instead of just the files themselves.  Beware of unintentionally matching the “..” hard link to the parent directory when using wildcards like “.*”.

#### Example

```
$ chmod -R 644 directory/
```

### Option `-h`

#### Description

If the -R option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.  This is the default.

#### Example

```
$ chmod -h 644 link
```
